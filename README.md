## Project Description

Timeless is a dating application that utilizes a unique "time gifting" system to encourage more meaningful and intentional communication between users. Users are given a limited amount of "time" to spend on sending and receiving messages, creating a sense of value and urgency around each interaction. The app also incorporates advanced security measures, and a range of engaging features to enhance the overall user experience such as a time ranking system. Overall, Timeless aims to foster genuine connections and promote a more intentional approach to online dating.

## Project Methodology

The software development process will be managed by our development team using Agile approach. This strategy places a focus on cooperation, adaptability, and ongoing improvement to make sure the software satisfies our clients' demands.

Key features of our Agile approach during this project include:

* Regular two week sprints: Our team will work in fortnightly sprints to deliver working and usable software in small increments

* Continuous Testing: We will test software throughout the development process to address any issues as early as possible

* Consistent Communication: We have established a regular meeting schedule, our team will meet fortnightly to discuss project progress and address any issues or concerns. In addition, we will have a weekly mentor meeting to receive guidance and support. Communication between team roles will be ongoing and frequent to ensure that everyone is aligned and working together effectively.
